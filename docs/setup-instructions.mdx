**Modify your Neovim Configuration:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Modify LSP Config (making sure to adjust capabilities as follows)">
    ```lua        
    -- An example nvim-lspconfig capabilities setting
    local capabilities = require("cmp_nvim_lsp").default_capabilities(vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities())
    
    require("lspconfig").markdown_oxide.setup({
        -- Ensure that dynamicRegistration is enabled! This allows the LS to take into account actions like the
        -- Create Unresolved File code action, resolving completions for unindexed code blocks, ...
        capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend(
            'force',
            capabilities,
            {
                workspace = {
                    didChangeWatchedFiles = {
                        dynamicRegistration = true,
                    },
                },
            }
        ),
        on_attach = on_attach -- configure your on attach config
    })
    ```
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="Modify your nvim-cmp configuration">
    Modify your nvim-cmp source settings for nvim-lsp (note: you must have nvim-lsp installed)

    ```lua        
    {
    name = 'nvim_lsp',
      option = {
        markdown_oxide = {
          keyword_pattern = [[\(\k\| \|\/\|#\)\+]]
        }
      }
    },
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="(optional) Enable Code Lens (eg for UI reference count)">
    Modify your lsp `on_attach` function.

    ```lua
    local function codelens_supported(bufnr)
      for _, c in ipairs(vim.lsp.get_clients({ bufnr = bufnr })) do
        if c.server_capabilities and c.server_capabilities.codeLensProvider then
          return true
        end
      end
      return false
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(
      { 'TextChanged', 'InsertLeave', 'CursorHold', 'BufEnter' },
      {
        buffer = bufnr,
        callback = function()
          if codelens_supported(bufnr) then
            vim.lsp.codelens.refresh({ bufnr = bufnr })
          end
        end,
      }
    )

    if codelens_supported(bufnr) then
      vim.lsp.codelens.refresh({ bufnr = bufnr })
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="(optional) Enable opening daily notes with natural language">
    Modify your lsp `on_attach` function to support opening daily notes with, for example, `:Daily two days ago` or `:Daily next monday`. 

    ```lua
    -- setup Markdown Oxide daily note commands
    if client.name == "markdown_oxide" then

      vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(
        "Daily",
        function(args)
          local input = args.args

          vim.lsp.buf.execute_command({command="jump", arguments={input}})

        end,
        {desc = 'Open daily note', nargs = "*"}
      )
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>    
- Ensure relevant plugins are installed:
    * [Nvim CMP](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp): UI for using LSP completions
    * [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): UI helpful for the LSP references implementation
        - Allows you to view and fuzzy match backlinks to files, headings, and blocks.
    * [Lspsaga](https://github.com/nvimdev/lspsaga.nvim): UI generally helpful for LSP commands
        + Allows you to edit linked markdown files in a popup window, for example. 


### VSCode

Install the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixZeller.markdown-oxide) (called `Markdown Oxide`). As for how the extension uses the language server, there are two options:
- **Recommended:** the extension will download the server's binary and use that
- The extension will use `markdown-oxide` from path

If you want to install to your path, use one of the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cargo Install (from source)">
    ```bash
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide.git markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cargo binstall (from hosted binary)">
    ```bash
    cargo binstall --git 'https://github.com/feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide' markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Winget (Windows)">
    ```bash
    winget install FelixZeller.markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Homebrew (from package manager)">
    ```bash
    brew install markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Other installation methods:**
- Arch Linux: `pacman -S markdown-oxide`
- Nix: `pkgs.markdown-oxide`
- Alpine Linux: `apk add markdown-oxide`

- The extension will use `markdown-oxide` from path

If you want to install to your path, use one of the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>

### Helix

For Helix, all you must do is install the language server's binary to your path using one of the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cargo Install (from source)">
    ```bash
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide.git markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cargo binstall (from hosted binary)">

    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Winget (Windows)">
    ```bash
    winget install FelixZeller.markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Homebrew (from package manager)">
    ```bash
    brew install markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Other installation methods:**
- Arch Linux: `pacman -S markdown-oxide`
- Nix: `pkgs.markdown-oxide`
- Alpine Linux: `apk add markdown-oxide`
- openSUSE: `zypper install markdown-oxide`
- Conda: `conda install conda-forge::markdown-oxide`

## Configuration

`Markdown-Oxide` supports several configuration options. All can be specified in a `~/.config/moxide/settings.toml` or `.moxide.toml` file. Moxide also tries to import some settings from Obsidian directly.

You can probably leave the settings as their defaults for now, but here are a few you may want to set.

- [Daily Note Format](/configuration#daily-note-format-config-option). If you have obsidian, this one is automatically imported if not set.
- Do you *not* use the first heading of your markdown files as the file title? You probably want to disable [title headings](/configuration#default-config-file)
- Do you have a specific folder where your daily notes are? Try [Daily Notes Folder](/configuration#default-config-file). *This may be imported from Obsidian*
- Do you have a specific folder where new files should be created? Try [New Files Folder](/configuration#default-config-file). *This may be imported from Obsidian*
- Do you want `.md` parsed and appended in your links? [MD Extension](/configuration#default-config-file)

# Using markdown-oxide

Now that you are set up, it is time to start using your new PKM! 

Most editors have an LSP interface that makes using Markdown-oxide's features intuitive. Over time, you will figure out a workflow that fits your needs. 

Additionally, you can reference the gifs and descriptions in the [Features Index](/features-index) to figure out how to use different features. 

I am working toward a future where all of markdown-oxide's features are thoroughly documented, but we are not there yet!

# Future steps

As you use Markdown Oxide more, there may be behavior you want to configure. For this, check the [Configuration](/configuration).

And if you want to have local access to the settings, here is the [default config file](/configuration#default-config-file) for you to copy and paste. 

I hope you enjoy! Feel free to open issues for bugs and features on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide
