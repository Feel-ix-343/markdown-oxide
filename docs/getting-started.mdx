    local capabilities = require("cmp_nvim_lsp").default_capabilities(vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities())
    
    require("lspconfig").markdown_oxide.setup({
        -- Ensure that dynamicRegistration is enabled! This allows the LS to take into account actions like the
        -- Create Unresolved File code action, resolving completions for unindexed code blocks, ...
        capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend(
            'force',
            capabilities,
            {
                workspace = {

                },
            }
        ),
        on_attach = on_attach -- configure your on attach config
    })
    ```
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="Modify your nvim-cmp configuration">
    Modify your nvim-cmp source settings for nvim-lsp (note: you must have nvim-lsp installed)

        }
      }
    },
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="(optional) Enable Code Lens (eg for UI reference count)">
    Modify your lsp `on_attach` function.

    ```lua
    local function codelens_supported(bufnr)
      for _, c in ipairs(vim.lsp.get_clients({ bufnr = bufnr })) do
        if c.server_capabilities and c.server_capabilities.codeLensProvider then
          return true
        end
      end
      return false
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(
      { 'TextChanged', 'InsertLeave', 'CursorHold', 'BufEnter' },
      {
        buffer = bufnr,
        callback = function()
          if codelens_supported(bufnr) then
            vim.lsp.codelens.refresh({ bufnr = bufnr })
          end
        end,
      }
    )

    if client.name == "markdown_oxide" then

      vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(
        "Daily",
        function(args)
          local input = args.args

          vim.lsp.buf.execute_command({command="jump", arguments={input}})

        end,
        {desc = 'Open daily note', nargs = "*"}
      )
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>    
- Ensure relevant plugins are installed:
    * [Nvim CMP](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp): UI for using LSP completions
    * [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): UI helpful for the LSP references implementation
        - Allows you to view and fuzzy match backlinks to files, headings, and blocks.
    * [Lspsaga](https://github.com/nvimdev/lspsaga.nvim): UI generally helpful for LSP commands
        + Allows you to edit linked markdown files in a popup window, for example. 


### VSCode

Install the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixZeller.markdown-oxide) (called `Markdown Oxide`). As for how the extension uses the language server, there are two options:
- **Recommended:** the extension will download the server's binary and use that
- The extension will use `markdown-oxide` from path

If you want to install to your path, use one of the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cargo Install (from source)">
    ```bash
    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide.git markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cargo binstall (from hosted binary)">
    ```bash
    cargo binstall --git 'https://github.com/feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide' markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Winget (Windows)">
    ```bash
    winget install FelixZeller.markdown-oxide
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Homebrew (from package manager)">

## Configuration

`Markdown-Oxide` supports several configuration options. All can be specified in a `~/.config/moxide/settings.toml` or `.moxide.toml` file. Moxide also tries to import some settings from Obsidian directly.

### Default Config File

This contains all possible settings with brief descriptions. A bit of elaboration on the settings is included after. 

```toml
# Leave blank to try to import from Obsidian Daily Notes
dailynote = "%Y-%m-%d" # this is akin to YYYY-MM-DD from Obsidian

# Fuzzy match file headings in completions
heading_completions = true

# Set true if you title your notes by the first heading
# Right now, if true this will cause completing a file link in the markdown style
# to insert the name of the first heading in the display text area
# [](file) -> [first heading of file.md](file)
# If false, [](file) -> [](file) (for example)
title_headings = true

# Show diagnostics for unresolved links; note that even if this is turned off, 
# special semantic tokens will be sent for the unresolved links, allowing you
# to visually identify unresolved links
unresolved_diagnostics = true

semantic_tokens = true

# Resolve tags in code blocks
tags_in_codeblocks = false
# Resolve references in code blocks
references_in_codeblocks = false

# The folder for new files to be created in; this is relevant for the code action that creates
# from an unresolved link. If not specified, it will import from your obsidian config option titled
# "Default Location for new notes" -- which is "" by default too. 
new_file_folder_path = ""


# The folder for new daily notes: this is applied for the create file for unresolved link code action
# as well as the Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, and Daily... lsp commands
#
# This is also imported from obsidian if not specified: specifically the option titled "New file location"
daily_notes_folder = ""


# Whether markdown links should include an extension or not
# for example [File](file.md) or [File](file)
include_md_extension_md_link = false

# Whether wikilinks should include an extension or not (needed for Markor compatibility)
# for example [[File]] or [[File.md]]
include_md_extension_wikilink = false

# Enable hover; this is relevant for VSCode and Zed where hover could be triggered on mouse hover
# and could be annoying
hover = true

# Handle case in fuzzy matches: Ignore | Smart | Respect
case_matching = "Smart"

# Enable inlay hints
inlay_hints = true
# Enable transclusion, in the form of inlay hints, for embedded block links: ![[link]]
# Inlay hints must be enabled
block_transclusion = true
# Full or Partial, for Partial, block_transclusion_length = { partial = 10 }
# block_transclusion must be enabled for this to take effect
block_transclusion_length = "Full"

# Link file names only
# Enables autocompleting by heading but inserting link to filename (instead of filename + heading)
# Useful for unique notes / Zettelkasten users
link_filenames_only = false
```

### Daily Note Format Config Option

```toml
dailynote = "{format}"
```
where format is `%Y-%m-%d` by default, unless imported from Obsidian.

From Obsidian, this works as follows:

Daily Note:
- `dailynote`: checks if you have the dailynote Obsidian plugin and translates this formatting to Markdown Oxide's date formatting

#### Relevance

This is used in the following places:

* Generating relative date name completions with predefined relative names (`today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `next {monday,tuesday,..., sunday}`, `last {monday,tuesday,...}`) for Daily Note Completions
* Creating new daily notes when opening them
* Creating files from unresolved references when the files match the specified format

#### Date Formatting

The date formatting in the config follows the rust library Chrono's formatting. 

The full specification can be found here: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html

Some examples are:

- Year
    * `%Y`: Is the four digit year
    * `%y`: Is the two digit year: 1979 -> 79
- Month
    * `%m`: Is the two digit month
    * `%b`: Is the abbreviated month name; 3 letters
    * `%B`: Full moth name or 3 letter abbreviation
- Day
    * `%d`: Is the two digit day of month
    * `%e`: Is the one or two digit day of month
    * `%a`: 3 letter abbreviated weekday name
    * `%A`: Abbreviated or full weekday name

Examples:
* (the default) `YYYY-MM-DD` -> `%Y-%m-%d`
* "1 Jan 2024" => `%d %b %Y`

### Settings From Obsidian

* Daily Note:
    + `dailynote`: checks if you have the dailynote Obsidian plugin and translates this formatting to Markdown Oxide's date formatting
* `new_file_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new files you set in Obsidian if you have it enabled. This is relevant to the Create Unresolved File Code Action
* `daily_notes_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new daily notes you set in the Obsidian Daily Notes plugin, if you have this option enabled. This is relevant to the path for opening daily notes and for the code action that creates unresolved links if they have the `dailynote` format.

## Using Markdown-Oxide

Now that you are set up, it is time to start using your new PKM! 

Most editors have an LSP interface that makes using Markdown-oxide's features intuitive. Over time, you will figure out a workflow that fits your needs. 

The main page provides an overview of all the key features with visual examples to help you understand what's possible.

I hope you enjoy! Feel free to open issues for bugs and features on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide
