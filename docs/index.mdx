# Markdown-Oxide

**A powerful PKM Language Server that brings Obsidian-like features to your favorite text editor.**

Markdown-Oxide is a [PKMS](/reference/pkms) that composes with your favorite text-editor through the [LSP](/reference/lsp). While other [PKMS](/reference/pkms) implementations include their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is *unbundled*: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.
