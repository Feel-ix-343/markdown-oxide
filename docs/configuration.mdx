`Markdown-Oxide` supports several configuration options. All can be specified in a `~/.config/moxide/settings.toml` or `.moxide.toml` file. Moxide also tries to import some settings from Obsidian directly.

# Default Config File

This contains all possible settings with brief descriptions. A bit of elaboration on the settings is included after. 

```toml
# Leave blank to try to import from Obsidian Daily Notes
dailynote = "%Y-%m-%d" # this is akin to YYYY-MM-DD from Obsidian

# Fuzzy match file headings in completions
heading_completions = true

# Set true if you title your notes by the first heading
# Right now, if true this will cause completing a file link in the markdown style
# to insert the name of the first heading in the display text area
# [](file) -> [first heading of file.md](file)
# If false, [](file) -> [](file) (for example)
title_headings = true

# Show diagnostics for unresolved links; note that even if this is turned off, 
# special semantic tokens will be sent for the unresolved links, allowing you
# to visually identify unresolved links
unresolved_diagnostics = true

semantic_tokens = true

# Resolve tags in code blocks
tags_in_codeblocks = false
# Resolve references in code blocks
references_in_codeblocks = false

# The folder for new files to be created in; this is relevant for the code action that creates
# from an unresolved link. If not specified, it will import from your obsidian config option titled
# "Default Location for new notes" -- which is "" by default too. 
new_file_folder_path = ""


# The folder for new daily notes: this is applied for the create file for unresolved link code action
# as well as the Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, and Daily... lsp commands
#
# This is also imported from obsidian if not specified: specifically the option titled "New file location"
daily_notes_folder = ""


# Whether markdown links should include an extension or not
# for example [File](file.md) or [File](file)
include_md_extension_md_link = false

# Whether wikilinks should include an extension or not (needed for Markor compatibility)
# for example [[File]] or [[File.md]]
include_md_extension_wikilink = false

# Enable hover; this is relevant for VSCode and Zed where hover could be triggered on mouse hover
# and could be annoying
hover = true

# Handle case in fuzzy matches: Ignore | Smart | Respect
case_matching = "Smart"

# Enable inlay hints
inlay_hints = true
# Enable transclusion, in the form of inlay hints, for embedded block links: ![[link]]
# Inlay hints must be enabled
block_transclusion = true
# Full or Partial, for Partial, block_transclusion_length = { partial = 10 }
# block_transclusion must be enabled for this to take effect
block_transclusion_length = "Full"

# Link file names only
# Enables autocompleting by heading but inserting link to filename (instead of filename + heading)
# Useful for unique notes / Zettelkasten users
link_filenames_only = false
```

# Daily Note Format Config Option

```toml
dailynote = "{format}"
```
where format is `%Y-%m-%d` by default, unless imported from Obsidian.

From Obsidian, this works as follows:

Daily Note:
- `dailynote`: checks if you have the dailynote Obsidian plugin and translates this formatting to Markdown Oxide's date formatting
- Info on this date formatting can be found [here](/date-formatting)

## Relevance

This is used in the following places

* Generating [relative date name completions](/daily-notes#completion-names) with predefined relative names (`today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `next {monday,tuesday,..., sunday}`, `last {monday,tuesday,...}`) such that we get Daily Note Completions
* Creating new daily notes in [Opening Daily Notes](/features-index#opening-daily-notes)
* [Creating files from unresolved references](/features-index#code-actions) when the files match the specified format

## Date Formatting

The date formatting in the config follows the rust library Chrono's formatting. 

The full specification can be found here: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html

Some examples are:

- Year
    * `%Y`: Is the four digit year
    * `%y`: Is the two digit year: 1979 -> 79
- Month
    * `%m`: Is the two digit month
    * `%b`: Is the abbreviated month name; 3 letters
    * `%B`: Full moth name or 3 letter abbreviation
- Day
    * `%d`: Is the two digit day of month
    * `%e`: Is the one or two digit day of month
    * `%a`: 3 letter abbreviated weekday name
    * `%A`: Abbreviated or full weekday name

Examples:
* (the default) `YYYY-MM-DD` -> `%Y-%m-%d`
* "1 Jan 2024" => `%d %b %Y`

# Settings From Obsidian

* Daily Note:
    + `dailynote`: checks if you have the dailynote Obsidian plugin and translates this formatting to Markdown Oxide's date formatting
    + Info on this date formatting can be found [here](/date-formatting)
* `new_file_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new files you set in Obsidian if you have it enabled. This is relevant to the [Create Unresolved File Code Action](/features-index#code-actions)
* `daily_notes_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new daily notes you set in the Obsidian Daily Notes plugin, if you have this option enabled. This is relevant to the path for [opening daily notes](/features-index#opening-daily-notes) and for [the code action that creates unresolved links](/features-index#code-actions) if they have the `dailynote` format.
