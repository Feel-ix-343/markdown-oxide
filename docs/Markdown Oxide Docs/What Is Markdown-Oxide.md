# What is Markdown-Oxide?

- ^whatIsMarkdownOxide

  Markdown-Oxide is a [[Personal Knowledge Management System|Personal Knowledge Management System(PKM)]] that composes with your favorite text-editor through the [Language Server Protocol(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

  While other PKMs implement their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is _unbundled_: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.

## Core Principles

1. **Unbundled Design**: Use your preferred text editor - Neovim, VSCode, Zed, Helix, or any editor that supports LSP
2. **Markdown-First**: Built to enhance plain Markdown files without requiring proprietary formats
3. **Minimal & Fast**: Optimized for performance with large knowledge bases
4. **Obsidian-Compatible**: Designed to work with existing Obsidian vaults

## Who Is Markdown Oxide For?

Markdown Oxide is ideal for:

- Power users who prefer using their customized text editors
- Developers who want PKM integrated with their existing toolchain
- Anyone seeking a lightweight alternative to full-featured PKM applications
- Users who value speed and minimal resource usage
