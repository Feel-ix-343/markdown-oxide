    # What is Markdown-Oxide
    
    Markdown-Oxide is a Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) that composes with your favorite text-editor through the Language Server Protocol (LSP).
    
    While other PKMS implementations include their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is *unbundled*: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.
