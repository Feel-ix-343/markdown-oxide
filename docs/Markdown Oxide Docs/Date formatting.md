    * `%y`: Is the two digit year: 1979 -> 79
- Month
    * `%m`: Is the two digit month
    * `%b`: Is the abbreviated month name; 3 letters
    * `%B`: Full moth name or 3 letter abbreviation
- Day
    * `%d`: Is the two digit day of month
    * `%e`: Is the one or two digit day of month
    * `%a`: 3 letter abbreviated weekday name
