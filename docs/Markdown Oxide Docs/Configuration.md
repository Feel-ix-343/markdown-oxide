`Markdown-Oxide` supports several configuration options. All can be specified in a `~/.config/moxide/settings.toml` or `.moxide.toml` file. Moxide also tries to import some settings from Obsidian directly.   ^configurationinfo

# Default Config File

This contains all possible settings with brief descriptions. A bit of elaboration on the settings is included after. 

```toml
# Leave blank to try to import from Obsidian Daily Notes
dailynote = "%Y-%m-%d" # this is akin to YYYY-MM-DD from Obsidian

# Fuzzy match file headings in completions
heading_completions = true

# Set true if you title your notes by the first heading
# Right now, if true this will cause completing a file link in the markdown style
# to insert the name of the first heading in the display text area
# [](file) -> [first heading of file.md](file)
# If false, [](file) -> [](file) (for example)
title_headings = true

# Show diagnostics for unresolved links; note that even if this is turned off, 
# special semantic tokens will be sent for the unresolved links, allowing you
# to visually identify unresolved links
unresolved_diagnostics = true

semantic_tokens = true

# Resolve tags in code blocks
tags_in_codeblocks = false
# Resolve references in code blocks
references_in_codeblocks = false

# The folder for new files to be created in; this is relevant for the code action that creates
# from an unresolved link. If not specified, it will import from your obsidian config option titled
# "Default Location for new notes" -- which is "" by default too. 
new_file_folder_path = ""


# The folder for new daily notes: this is applied for the create file for unresolved link code action
# as well as the Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, and Daily... lsp commands
#
# This is also imported from obsidian if not specified: specifically the option titled "New file location"
daily_notes_folder = ""


# Whether markdown links should include an extension or not
# for example [File](file.md) or [File](file)
include_md_extension_md_link = false

# Whether wikilinks should include an extension or not (needed for Markor compatibility)
# for example [[File]] or [[File.md]]
include_md_extension_wikilink = false

# Enable hover; this is relevant for VSCode and Zed where hover could be triggered on mouse hover
# and could be annoying
hover = true

# Handle case in fuzzy matches: Ignore | Smart | Respect
case_matching = "Smart"

# Enable inlay hints
inlay_hints = true
# Enable transclusion, in the form of inlay hints, for embedded block links: ![[link]]
# Inlay hints must be enabled
block_transclusion = true
# Full or Partial, for Partial, block_transclusion_length = { partial = 10 }
# block_transclusion must be enabled for this to take effect
block_transclusion_length = "Full"

# Link file names only
# Enables autocompleting by heading but inserting link to filename (instead of filename + heading)
# Useful for unique notes / Zettelkasten users
link_filenames_only = false
```

# Daily Note Format Config Option

```toml
dailynote = "{format}"
```
where format is `%Y-%m-%d` by default, unless imported from Obsidian.

From Obsidian, this works as follows ![[#^1862g]]

## Relevance

This is used in the following places

* Generating [relative date name completions](<Daily Notes.md#Completion Names>) with ![[Daily Notes#^predefinedNames|predefined relative names]] such that we get [[Features Index#^implDailyNoteComp|Daily Note Completions]]
* Creating new daily notes in [[Features Index#Opening Daily Notes]]
* [Creating files from unresolved references](<Features Index.md#Code Actions>) when the files match the specified format

## Date Formatting

![[Date Formatting]]

# Settings From Obsidian

- ... ^someobsidiansettings
    * Daily Note:
        + `dailynote`: checks if you have the dailynote Obsidian plugin and translates this formatting to Markdown Oxide's date formatting   ^1862g
        + Info on this date formatting can be found [here](<Date Formatting.md>)
    * `new_file_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new files you set in Obsidian if you have it enabled. This is relevant to the [Create Unresolved File Code Action](<Features Index.md#^implCodeAction>)
    * `daily_notes_folder_path`: uses the specific folder for new daily notes you set in the Obsidian Daily Notes plugin, if you have this option enabled. This is relevant to the path for [opening daily notes](<Features Index.md#Opening Daily Notes>) and for [the code action that creates unresolved links](<Features Index.md#^implCodeAction>) if they have the `dailynote` format.
