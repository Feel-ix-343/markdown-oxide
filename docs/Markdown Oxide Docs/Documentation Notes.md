# Notes

- The features listed in this wiki's pages are a work in progress. Currently, v1 is almost entirely unimplemented, while almost all in v0 is implemented. V1 is really just the dream I am working toward for Markdown Oxide, I hope it's okay that I share! ^workinprogress
    - Checkboxes are used to indicate which features are implemented vs which ones are planned.
    - Planned features may be scrapped. 
- I frequently use embeds to curate content into articles/views. These views are meant to be read as seen -- don't feel the need to navigate to the source document.  ^docEmbeds
    * Since I do not want to reuse the headings, I am doing some hackery with lists and block embeds. Practically, this works, but for now you will notice it is a little ugly. If I chose not to do this hackery, you will see an odd heading name in the document outline
    * If the page looks wrong, reload
    * If the table of contents is not working, just wait a few seconds and it will.
