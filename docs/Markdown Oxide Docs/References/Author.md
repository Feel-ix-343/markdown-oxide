I am Felix Zeller, the maintainer of Markdown-Oxide

- I spend hours each day using markdown-oxide to...
    * **Learn**, which currently involves...
        + Functional Programming + Category Theory
        + Philosophy: Logic + Symbolic Logic, Mind, and Eastern Philosophy
            + this may explain my interest in PKM :)
    * **Think**: Solve problems in the things I am working on
    * **Plan**: Manage tasks in open source, school, and personal life
- I have been contributing to open-source since 2020. View my github [Here]
- other than this, I lift weights, do cycling, socialize, and *do* nothing.
