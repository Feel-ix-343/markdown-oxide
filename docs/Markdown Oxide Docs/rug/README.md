# Rug

> Conceptually placing files under a `/rug`

@adriangalilea's convention for files that need sorting.

Note: Avoid keeping WIP, unclear, or conceptual files in the main documentation branch as they pollute the documentation experience.

## TODO:

- [ ] Review all files in this folder and make a decision about each:
  - [ ] Either delete files completely if they're not needed
  - [ ] Or move development content to a separate feature branch
- [ ] Delete the `/rug` folder after processing all files
